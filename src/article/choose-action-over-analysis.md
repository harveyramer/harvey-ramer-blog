Beside me are books filled with business advice and technological innovations. A laptop with an internet connection enables me to write this article. Mind-blowing discoveries and groundbreaking ideas are at my fingertips.

We live amid an information explosion[^1]. We have more knowledge available to us now than at any other time in history. Yet, many of us fail to enjoy its benefits. Why is this?

I cannot speak for everyone, but I have noticed a pattern in my own life. I am fascinated with ideas that have potential. I spend time and put forth significant effort learning how to apply those ideas. But instead of taking immediate action, I file away a new strategy or tactic for future use.

We became idea collectors in school, and our teachers cheered us on. Their lessons filled our heads with fascinating ideas, and they often demanded nothing of us in return except the ability to remember concepts for a test. As adults, we strive to keep up that work. We memorize more and more facts to deal with the unrelenting volume of ideas pouring into our lives. Like unrelenting breakers, the information rolls over us. Due to all this information overload[^2], some of us stop learning. We surrender.

There is an alternative. We commit to applying what we learn. We equate learning with action. We no longer seek to master the memorization of unapplied ideas.

When an idea catches our attention, we ask, "Am I ready to apply this idea if it proves valuable?" If the answer is "No." we move on to other things without regret.

We stop learning about everything others tell us we should do. Instead, we focus on the next valuable thing for our business or personal growth. We focus on learning those things that allow us to make progress toward our goal.
