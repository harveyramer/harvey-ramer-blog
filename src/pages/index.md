  title: Why Pursuit?

    Software is never perfect. It is always in process. Success requires
    relentless pursuit of customer-centered solutions.

  To succeed, teams need clear vision. Without it, technical workers are stifled
  micro-management. Hire smart, motivated people, give them a clear vision and
  free them from needless rules.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
