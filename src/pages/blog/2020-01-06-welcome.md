## I Am Memphis-Based a Software Engineer

Careers are dynamic things. Only a few years ago, I graduated from school with a degree in visual communications. But I didn't work in a pure design role for long.

With joy, I began designing websites, but soon found that brochure-ware didn't help my customers. They needed real interactions. They wanted to sell things. They needed websites to be an extension of their businessâ€”to produce revenue.

Listening to their requests, I learned PHP and JavaScript in addition to the HTML/CSS with which I began. I built more rich websites on top of open source tools, especially WordPress.

For the past 16 years, I have arrived at work every day ready to learn something new. This means I now can call myself _"software engineer"_ in addition to _"designer"_.

## What to Expect

As time allows (hopefully once a week) I will write an article on startups, programming, or team dynamics. I am interested specifically in cloud architecture and have worked quite a bit with AWS, so expect some articles on that.

Please contact me with any requests.
