Though we can install NodeJS directly on a Windows 10 computer, it is better to use a package manager. Versions change quickly, and you may need to switch between projects that require different versions. 

Download the latest [Node Version Manager for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).
